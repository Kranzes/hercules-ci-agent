= `hci login`

Configure token for authentication to hercules-ci.com or Hercules CI Enterprise.

This will present a unique URL for a page where you can approve the login.

When successful, an authentication token is persisted to 
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hercules-ci/credentials.json`, which is
`~/.config/hercules-ci/credentials.json` on most systems.

This token can then be used by the other `hci` subcommands.

Users of Hercules CI Enterprise should set the `HERCULES_CI_API_BASE_URL`
environment variable in their profile and/or session before logging in and
before running any other commands.
