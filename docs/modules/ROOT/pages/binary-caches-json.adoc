[[binary-caches-json]]
= The `binary-caches.json` format

The `binary-caches.json` file configures the agent to use a binary cache.

A `binary-caches.json` with a single pushable cache looks like:

[[binary-caches-json-cachix-example]]
[source,json,reftext="the example"]
----
{ "mycache": <1>
    { "kind": "CachixCache" <2>
    , "publicKeys": ... <3>
    , ...
    }
}
----
<1> An identifier for the cache. It has to be consistent with your other agents (if any). In case of Cachix, it must match the name of the cache; for example the `mycache` part from `mycache.cachix.org`.
<2> A `kind` field to distinguish between cache types. Values: `CachixCache` or `NixCache` (since agent 0.7.1)
<3> Further details about the cache.

== Top-level dictionary

The top-level object represents a dictionary from cache names to objects with the cache's details and secrets.

Multiple caches can be specified this way. Currently the cache name in the dictionary is also used
directly as the Cachix cache name.

[source,json]
----
{ "mycache": ...
, "some-other-cache": ...
}
----

== `CachixCache`

The name for a cache is taken from the key in the top-level dictionary, such as `mycache` in <<binary-caches-json-cachix-example>>.

The details of a cachix cache can be specified with the following fields:

[[CachixCache-kind]]
`kind`::
A field of type string with the value `CachixCache`.

[[CachixCache-authToken]]
`authToken`::
An optional field of type string.
+
This is a secret token to authenticate the agent to `cachix.org`.
+
This field should be omitted when configuring a publicly readable Cachix cache with a local signing key (as configured in `signingKeys`).
+
It is required when the cache uses a Cachix managed signing key via Write token.

[[CachixCache-publicKeys]]
`publicKeys`::
A list of strings.
+
These are required to verify the integrity of cached store paths and to accept them into the Nix store. They are the public counterpart to the signing keys.
+
You may look up the public keys by going to `https://<cache-name>.cachix.org`.
+
A public key looks like `mycache.cachix.org-1:WsUIffActpYsfyxIZrfm6OXRHdNHkHk+X/lUsDTGtJS=`

[[CachixCache-signingKeys]]
`signingKeys`::
A list of strings.
+
Omit when using a _Write_ token instead of a local signing key. Otherwise, this is the cache-specific secret key to sign store paths.
+
You can find it in `~/.config/cachix/cachix.dhall` or your key backup after following the setup instructions on cachix.org.
+
The keys are in Base64 format.
+
Only a single signing key is https://github.com/cachix/cachix/issues/146[currently] supported.

== `NixCache`

*Since agent 0.7.1*

The details of a generic Nix-supported cache can be specified with `NixCache`.

The Nix manual has more information about https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ssec-s3-substituter[operating an S3 binary cache].

You may use existing keys or you can use the https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#operation-generate-binary-cache-key[`nix-store --generate-binary-cache-key`] command to generate keys for a new cache.

[[NixCache-kind]]
`kind`::
A field of type string with the value `NixCache`.


[[NixCache-storeURI]]
`storeURI`::
The Nix Store URI to use when accessing the cache. For example
+
```text
s3://my-nix-cache?region=us-east-1&profile=my-agent-cache-credentials
```
+
where `my-nix-cache` is the name of the bucket and `my-agent-cache-credentials` references an entry in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-configure-files-where[`~/.aws/credentials`] in the agent's home directory (typically `~hercules-ci-agent/.aws/credentials`) *AND* in the root directory (`~root/.aws/credentials`). The latter is for `nix-daemon`, which is what most installations use.

[[NixCache-publicKeys]]
`publicKeys`::
A list of strings.
+
These are required to verify the integrity of cached store paths and to accept them into the Nix store. They are the public counterpart to the `signingKeys`.


[[NixCache-signingKeys]]
`signingKeys`::
A list of strings.
+
This is a cache-specific secret key to sign store paths.
+
The keys are in Base64 format. As of writing they are Ed25519 keys, where a signing key is about 88 characters after the colon. A public key is half as long.
