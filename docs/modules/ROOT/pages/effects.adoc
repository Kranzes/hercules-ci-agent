= Effects

Effects provide a means to perform actions that affect real-world resources in a controlled manner.

This document serves as reference documentation.
See also the xref:hercules-ci:ROOT:effects/index.adoc[Effects Introduction] and the deployment guides in xref:hercules-ci-effects:ROOT:index.adoc[`hercules-ci-effects`].

== Running effects

Effects run as part of a xref:hercules-ci:ROOT:glossary.adoc#job[job], after all its builds have completed successfully and after preceding jobs for the same repository have completed effect execution.

== Sandbox type

Currently, effects run in Linux containers only. Note that you _can_ deploy to a macOS machine via SSH from a Linux agent using e.g. xref:hercules-ci-effects:ROOT:reference/nix-functions/runNixDarwin.adoc[hercules-ci-effects runNixDarwin].

[[paths]]
== Paths

This container contains at least the Nix store and `/dev`, `/proc`, `/sys`, each filled as appropriate for a container.

The store and a nix-daemon socket are accessible.

It may further provide `/etc/resolv.conf` and other files that are required for network access.

An empty directory is created, to serve as the working directory and `TMP`.

The `/bin/sh` and `/usr/bin/env` executables are _not_ provided by the sandbox and should be installed by the effect instead. Effects defined directly or indirectly through xref:hercules-ci-effects:ROOT:reference/nix-functions/mkEffect.adoc[hercules-ci-effects mkEffect] provide this xref:hercules-ci-effects:ROOT:reference/nix-functions/mkEffect.adoc#param-initScript[by default].

[[execution]]
== Execution

The process started inside the container is the builder, similar to how the Nix sandbox starts the derivation, but in the effects sandbox, the process appears as uid 0 ("root"), allowing it to modify the root filesystem as necessary. This is possible via uid remapping. The process does not gain any real privileges from being uid 0 in the effects sandbox.

[[environment]]
== Environment

These are the notable environment variables set by the sandbox itself.

[[IN_HERCULES_CI_EFFECT]]
=== `IN_HERCULES_CI_EFFECT`

Value: `true`

[[HERCULES_CI_API_BASE_URL]]
=== `HERCULES_CI_API_BASE_URL`

The xref:agent-config.adoc#apiBaseUrl[apiBaseUrl] configuration value.

[[HERCULES_CI_SECRETS_JSON]]
=== `HERCULES_CI_SECRETS_JSON`

A file path pointing to a file with secrets data.

See <<Secrets>>.

[[HERCULES_CI_PROJECT_ID]]
=== `HERCULES_CI_PROJECT_ID`

The `id` UUID of the project that created the job that contains the effect.

[[HERCULES_CI_PROJECT_PATH]]
=== `HERCULES_CI_PROJECT_PATH`

A slash separated string containing in order: the site name (typically `github`), the owner (user or organization) and the repository name.

Example: `github/hercules-ci/hercules-ci-agent`

== Secrets

The contents of `$HERCULES_CI_SECRETS_JSON` are computed by looking up the `secretsMap` values in the agent's xref:secrets-json.adoc[`secrets.json`], and filtering using the xref:secrets-json.adoc#condition[`condition`] field. Its contents arise from roughly the following pseudocode:

[source,nix,subs="+macros"]
----
agentSecrets = fromJSON (readFile xref:secrets-json.adoc[secrets.json]);
HERCULES_CI_SECRETS_JSON = writeSecureFile
  (
    (filterAttrs (k: secret: xref:secrets-json.adoc#condition[conditionHolds] secret.condition)
      (mapAttrs (k: agentSecretName: agentSecrets.${agentSecretName})
        drv.secretsMap
      )
    ) // {
      hercules-ci = {
        data.<<api-token,token>> = <<api-token,â€¦>>;
      };
    }
  );
----

[[api-token]]
=== API token

The `hercules-ci` secret is provided, containing a `token` string attribute in its `data`.
This token can be used with the Hercules CI API and has appropriate permissions for the effect's execution.

This is picked up automatically by the xref:hercules-ci-agent:hci:index.adoc[`hci` command] and hercules-ci-effects bash functions like xref:hercules-ci-effects:ROOT:reference/bash-functions/getStateFile.adoc[`getStateFile`].

[[network]]
== Network

Network access is provided via the container runtime used.

The current implementation is based on `runc` and bind mounts `/etc/resolv.conf`. If your host setup demands a different approach, please open an issue describing your needs or contact mailto:support@hercules-ci.com if you are hesitant to share any network information.
